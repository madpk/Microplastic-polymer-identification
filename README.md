# Microplastic-polymer-identification
Identifying microplastic polymer types from Raman peaks (.txt files) using open specy package.

Open specy is a tool (R package: "OpenSpecy") for identifying the polymer composition of microplastic particles from the peaks obtained from
Raman and (FT)IR spectral analysis. Herein, let's see  how we can select multiple .txt files containing the peaks corresponding to Raman spectra
and identify respective polymers.
