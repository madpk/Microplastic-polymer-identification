# Microplastic-polymer-identification-and-visualization
Identifying microplastic polymer types from Raman peaks (.txt files) using openspecy package.

Open specy is a tool for identifying the polymer composition of microplastic particles from the peaks obtained from
Raman and (FT)IR spectral analysis. Herein, let's see  how we can select multiple .txt files containing the peaks corresponding to Raman spectra
and identify respective polymers. Also, the plotting of these peaks using ggplot2 and saving them into your drive will be discussed.
