# Microplastic-polymer-identification-and-visualization

The identification of polymers from spectroscopic data has always been cumbersome when there are several files to be processed. However, using the  Open specy library we can easily obtain the polymer composition of microplastic particles from the spectroscopic data  (i.e., wave length & intensity) of Raman and (FT)IR. Herein, let's see  how we can select multiple .txt (or .csv) files  corresponding to Raman spectra and identify respective polymers. Also, codes required for plotting of these spectra using ggplot2 and saving them into your drive are given.
